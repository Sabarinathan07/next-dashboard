# Next.js Dashboard Application

This is a Next.js project that I have deployed. You can view the live application at [next.sabari.dev](https://next.sabari.dev).

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated web applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system.

## Deployment

The application is deployed and can be accessed at [next.sabari.dev](https://next.sabari.dev).

## Learning Resources

I have learned Next.js and Tailwind CSS through various resources, including the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) and the [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).
